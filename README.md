HELLO THIS IS MY PROJECT OF WEATHER APP.
THIS MADE USING HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT.
IN THIS YOU CAN SEARCH ANY CITY, AND CAN KNOW ITS WEATHER.
IF YOU WANT YOU CAN GIVE ACCESS TO YOUR LOCATION AND IT WILL SHOW WEATHER OF YOUR LOCATION.


I USED AN OPEN SOURCE API TO FETCH DATA OF A LOCATION FROM A WEATTHER SITE.
I ALSO USEDAN OPEN SOURCE API FOR LOCATION DETECTING
